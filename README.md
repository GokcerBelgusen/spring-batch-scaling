Basic and self contained samples for scaling options in spring batch. At this time, these samples build with 3.1.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT to utilize the remote chunking namespace support that will be available in the upcoming 3.1.0 release version. 

The theme to each sample is a user submits images that our job needs to resize. The path to the file is stored in the database, the image on disk residing in the "unprocessed" directory. The job will read the paths from the database and resize the image, writing it to the "processed" directory.

To build all, from the top level directory:

* mvn clean install

Running samples:

* Setup data locations:

  * mkdir -p $HOME/image_submissions/processed

  * mkdir $HOME/image_submissions/unprocessed
  
  * These locations can be changed in either the corresponding application.properties files or overridden by JVM parameters (-Dprop.name=val)

  * Image data obtained from: http://137.189.35.203/WebUI/CatDatabase/catData.html
  
    * Download "part 2" from: http://137.189.35.203/WebUI/CatDatabase/Data/CAT_DATASET_02.zip 
    
    * Extract the archive and move *.jpg into $HOME/image_submissions/unprocessed

Single thread sample

* java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar single-thread/target/single-thread-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar

Multi threaded sample

* java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar multi-threaded/target/multi-threaded-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar

Async processing sample

* java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar async-process/target/async-process-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar

Remote chunking sample:

* Start ActiveMQ locally (or modify the either applications.properties or override via JVM parameters (-Dprop.name=val))

* In separate consoles:

  * java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar remote-chunking/remote-chunking-slave/target/remote-chunking-slave-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar

  * java -jar remote-chunking/remote-chunking-master/target/remote-chunking-master-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar

* NOTE: You will probably want to spread these processes over multiple nodes rather than running on a single machine. See application.properties and modifiy or override with JVM parameters (-Dprop.name=val) as appropriate.

Remote partitioning sample:

* Start HSQLDB server:

  * java -cp /path/to/hsqldb-2.3.1.jar org.hsqldb.Server -database.0 file:mydb -dbname.0 partition
  
  * java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar remote-partitioning/remote-partitioning-slave/target/remote-partitioning-slave-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar
  
  * java -jar remote-partitioning/remote-partitioning-master/target/remote-partitioning-master-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar 

* NOTE: You will probably want to spread these processes over multiple nodes rather than running on a single machine. Also, you will probably want to use a regular RDBMS. See application.properties and modifiy or override with JVM parameters (-Dprop.name=val) as appropriate.

Launching batch jobs through messages / Get feedback with informational messages sample:

* Start ActiveMQ locally (or modify the either applications.properties or override via JVM parameters (-Dprop.name=val)). ActiveMQ is used to send the information message about the duration of the job via a JMS message.

* Setup data locations:

  * mkdir -p $HOME/image_submissions/bulk

    * This directory will be scanned by Spring Integration for zip files to use when launching a job

  * Zip the contents of the images in $HOME/image_submissions/unprocessed that were extracted in the "Setup data locations" section of "Running samples"
    * NOTE: in this sample, you can also zip up any images of your choice rather than using ones from the "unprocessed" directory. Just use the .jpg extension and .zip format. Rather than demonstrating a job processing predefined "user submitted" images, its a bit more generic and will process any zip file containing .jpg images. 

    * The filename can be anything as long as it ends in .zip

  * java -Djava.awt.headless=true -jar message-job-launch/target/message-job-launch-1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT.jar

    * This will start the application, Spring Integration will pickup the zip file and invoke the batch job with the file name. The batch job will then uncompress the archive into the "unprocessed" directory as with other samples. Upon completion, rather than logging the time it took for the job to complete, a message will be put onto the "notifications" queue in ActiveMQ.
